They decided to organize an internal Hackathon to perfect this prototype in order to be able to build native apps with this technology.[13]\n\nAfter months of development, Facebook released the first version for the React JavaScript Configuration in 2015. During a technical talk,[14] Christopher Chedeau explained that Facebook was already using React Native in production for their Group App and their Ads Manager App.[15]"
